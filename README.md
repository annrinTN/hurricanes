 <h2> HURDAT2 data analysis<h2>
NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has been keeping records of tropical storms and hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean since 1851. HURDAT 2 is the name for the official U.S. database of these storms. The early observations were made by ships or estimated by land-based observers.

* Given trends you identify in the weather data, how is the nature of hurricanes changing?
	-Are hurricanes becoming more frequent? 
	-Are they more severe from a strength standpoint (wind speed, rainfall, etc.)?
	-Are they more severe from a damage caused (paid losses) standpoint?
  
* Given everything you learned, can you make an educated guess on:
        -The number of hurricanes we should expect to see in the 2020 hurricane season?
